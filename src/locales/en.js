      aboutText: `
Psychotherapy is the professional place that defines me. Throughout all these years of activity, I have accompanied many people in their therapeutic process, with openness and gratitude. I have understood in each a form of inner strength, something unique. My professional path and my own life have led me to a comprehensive understanding of people in different life situations.
I am a Clinical Psychologist and Integrative Psychotherapist, accredited by the Romanian College of Psychologists. I have gained experience in diverse work contexts and constantly challenged myself to learn more. All stages of my professional training have given me knowledge and emotional resources to support people who want to undertake their own therapeutic process with me.
I have chosen an Integrative Psychotherapeutic approach because it allows a complete picture of life, in all significant planes. Together we will explore your life context, the thoughts that influence your emotions. We will also understand what determines certain behaviors you may no longer want, building understanding and meaningful learning. We will observe your health and how your body reflects your feelings. At the highest dimension of the psyche is the need to give meaning to life. It is about what you offer others as personal creation, encounters, and experiences. It is the higher level of consciousness that gives a deeper understanding of life and how you choose to live every moment. I will be part of the therapeutic relationship and invite you to be part as well. We will create a confidential and trusting space.

About Psychotherapy
You have a life story that defines you. By understanding parts of your life, you become whole. There are also parts you cannot face, whether painful or misunderstood, and therefore unresolved in some way, becoming aspects that limit your strength and ability in the present moment. There are important moments in life and many are difficult – major changes, divorce, moving into a new life stage, important decisions, material, psychological, or physical losses, moments of fear, discouragement, or simply feeling lost. These life thresholds shouldn’t all be faced alone. If they become difficult to cross, it’s natural to seek professional help.
I invite you to explore yourself with me over time, to understand and organize certain aspects of your life with clarity, and to build beneficial and useful ways for you to act. Allow past, present, and future to coexist harmoniously. Together we will pay attention to your daily life to facilitate what you desire. I will accompany you in your journey of growth until you know you have your own solutions at hand.
